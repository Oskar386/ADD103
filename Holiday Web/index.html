        <h2>Why I love Fall</h2>
        <p>
            The first cool breeze after summer feels like a reset. I finally swap shorts for
            <strong style="color:#8b5e34;">hoodies</strong> my favorite layer, because fall is the sweet spot
            between “too hot to think” and “too cold to move.” It’s also when streets, parks,
            and forest preserves shift into a warm palette of burnt orange, amber, and deep
            maroon. The air smells cleaner, like wood and rain; even busy days slow down a bit.
            I like to take longer routes when I drive, just to watch the tree lines change color
            across the horizon and see sunlight flicker through the leaves. Those moments make the
            ordinary feel cinematic.

        <h2>Drinks &amp; Comfort</h2>
        <h3>Warm Cocoa or Tea Season</h3>
        <p>
            Fall is the official start of <strong style="color:#8b5e34;">Warm Cocoa and Tea</strong>
            season. A mug in hand changes the whole pace of a day—whether it’s a quick break
            between classes or a late-night study session. Cocoa is my “reward” drink after a
            long day; black tea is my go-to focus mode. Either way, the warmth matches the
            season and turns a regular desk into a small, calm corner.

        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <h3>Golden Horizons</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite activity is simple: driving through tree-lined roads or walking in a park
            with leaves that look like a painting. If there’s time, I’ll park and walk a trail just
            to hear the crunch of leaves and take a few photos. It’s not about big travel plans;
            it’s about noticing how familiar places transform for a few weeks and appreciating
            that window while it lasts. Even a quick loop around the neighborhood feels new when
            the treetops glow and the sky goes copper at sunset.
